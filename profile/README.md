# Nox Protocol

Nox is a privacy-first layer for DeFi — trustless, sovereign, and compliance-ready by design.

## Key Features

- **Confidential by default** — Computations run in hardware-secured enclaves (TEEs), keeping sensitive data protected while ensuring authenticity
- **Simple developer experience** — Interact with encrypted data through opaque handles and familiar Solidity primitives (`TEEPrimitive.add()`, `TEEPrimitive.sub()`, ...)
- **Pre-built confidential operations** — Transfers, swaps, lending ready to use out-of-the-box
- **Native composability** — Discover, reuse, and chain confidential operations like standard on-chain building blocks
- **Compliance-ready** — Full sovereignty over your data with programmable disclosure
